# 3dglove


Virtual reality haptic glove, venture finalist in Startup Challenge. Software on Mac used the Leap Motion controller to determine user hand location and fed that info into a physics engine to determine where the hand collided with virtual shapes. That collision information was then used to vibrate the glove at the location and with correct collision intensity to provide haptic feedback to user about touching objects in 3D virtual space.
